# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists. It points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context; read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area about to be changed. In multi-context repositories, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files do not exist, proceed silently. Do not flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill, reached through `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`, creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This repository uses the single-context layout:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── app/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If a required concept is absent from the glossary, reconsider whether the language belongs to the project or note the genuine gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly instead of silently overriding it:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because..._
